# Linux Banter Bot

## Adding a command
Please include any command you add in the `HELP_REPLY` string.
### Simple commands
All standard commands are automatically preceded by "bot", so there is no need to add that.
Simply add the command name and resolver function to the `commandMap` object:
```
const commandMap = {
  ...
  "newcommand": resolverFunction
  ...
}
```
For example,
```
const commandMap = {
  ...
  "foo": () => reply("bar")
}
```
Note that `reply` is a standard function used by other commands too. **Only put function definitions in the commandMap if they are short**. If they exceed one short line, then define the function somewhere else and reference it:
```
const bar = () => {
  // Do something more involved
}
const commandMap = {
  ...
  "foo": {
   default: defaultt
  }
}
```
### Nested commands
For nested commands, such as `bot echo sticker`, you can define the command as an object:
```
const commandMap = {
  ...
  "foo": {
    default: doDefault, // "bot foo" (set this to invalidCommand if it's not allowed)
    "bar": doSomething, // "bot foo bar"
    "baz": doSomethingElse, // "bot foo baz"
  }
}
```
See the "echo" command for a concrete example. **You can nest as deeply as you want!**
